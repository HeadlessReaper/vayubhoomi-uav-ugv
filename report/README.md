# Summer-Internship-Report-22

The repository will serve as a base for the format the interns have to follow to submit their final reports as a part of the Summer Internship. We've added a few topics to make it easier for you to navigate your report writing.

# Guidelines

Before you get started with your report, there are a few guidelines we would like for the interns to adhere to making it easier for everyone involved in the process. 
1. The Sections of the report are to be strictly adhered to. Please ensure you do justice to the content that falls under each section. You can always reach out to your fellow interns, mentors, and lab seniors for guidance. 
2. As previously mentioned, the report is to be strictly written in LaTeX. We hope the LaTeX session helped you get started. If you need additional help, there is a section in the ReadMe dedicated to it :)
3. Although we appreciate flowcharts and diagrams, please use them judiciously and try to not flood your reports with images. If there is additional content that you would like us to consider but doesn't fit in well with your report, feel free to add them in the appendices. 

# Getting Started

Once you've read the guidelines, let's get started. Here's a rundown on how to work with these files. 

1. Clone the repository or download the archive file
2. Extract the archive on your computer
3. Open your LaTeX editor of choice and open main.tex
5. Modify the coverpage in the LaTeX editor before getting started 
4. Make your changes and proceed to compile the report.

# Need Help
LaTeX has a decent learning curve and it's completely alright for the interns to reach out to anyone in Lab for help. However, we've included a few resources in this repository to make it easier. 

Please find all the content from the LaTeX session in the resources folder which should help out with a good chunk of the basic LaTeX commands. 

If you need more help, our first recommendation would be to google it :) LaTeX has its Stack Exchange page linked [here](https://tex.stackexchange.com/). 

Additionally, Overleaf has extensive documentation for LaTeX which should suffice. If you haven't found a solution or would prefer to ask a human, you can always reach out to Lab Members!
