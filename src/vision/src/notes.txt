TO DO :

- write a node to detect cans using cvBridge [DONE]
- write a node to localize the cans [IN PROGRESS]
- write a pre-programmed route for the drone to take off and traverse through
- combine the last three
- launch all of the above using a launch file (environment with cans)
- spawn turtlebot & hector quadrotor in an environment (using launch file)

General notes :

- after collecting a list of all quadrotor pose projections, how to get rid of redundant locations
