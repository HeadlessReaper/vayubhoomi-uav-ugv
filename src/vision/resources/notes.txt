TO DO (MIM5):

- create new branch for vision code [DONE]
- cluster the collected data points [DONE]
- write a bounding box classifier program for a generic image dataset 
- find a dataset for simulated/real trash piles in that order
- write a spirally diminishing hector quadrotor control program [DONE (SAMUEL)]
- get launch file for quadrotor and turtlebot simultaneous spawning [DONE (PRAMUK)]

General notes :

- the drone will capture a video feed throughout its path 
- the video feed will be sent to a base station for point identification
- point identification will occur at the base station using an appropriately trained bounding box classifier written using pytorch
- clustering will occur at the same base station
- location to which forwarding of the clustered locations will occur is unclear at this point (i.e.; to another node at the base station or to the UGV?)
